# Running the code
'python tools.py <extension>'

To run our project, an extension must be supplied. Available extensions are as follows:
generate -- generates a new dataset of the selected number of instances per class. WARNING: this will overwrite the existing dataset and can be very time-consuming.
train    -- Train new models based on the dataset. You will be queried on whether to overwrite or keep existing models.
evaluate -- Run the models through a test case in order to observe the behavior of the models and see accuracy metrics.
